    "We'll be starting this series with an analysis of a credit card fraud dataset. We're going to use this as an example of one of the most common enterprise use cases for machine learning: a learning to rank problem. In these cases we are looking to prioritize a set of records for escalation into some form of a review process. In this particular case, we'll be looking to identify payment records that might be fraudulent. In a company such as Visa or Stripe, records that score highly might be automatically blocked, while those with mid-level scores would be sent to a domain expert such as a fraud analyst for a decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key piece of this is the model that identifies the records of interest. Here we will look at several options for models that generate a probability measure or numeric score for each record. The advantage of this approach is that:\n",
    "1. We can rank order the list to ensure that the highest value records are examined first, and\n",
    "2. we can work our way as deeply into the list as we like, deciding to allocate more resources if we want to go deeper or less if we're capturing enough value with those records at the top.\n",

Moreover, if we decided that we wanted a specific prediction, we can see that we could easily set a threshold which would yield greater than an 80% true positive rate at the cost of very few false positives. We could also go higher depending on whether our expected losses justify the extra expenditure. (Remember that the actual fraud rate is very low- a false positive rate of 1% means we will flag 2800 records in our dataset that aren't fraudulent that we'll need to sort through by manual review. So the expected loss must be high.)"

We could do this by combining and crossing terms together, but a better option is to build a deep network and allow it to figure out the relationships for itself. We've already learned not to try to interpret the model parameters, so it's only one step further to move to a black box model."

We should be working with lower level libraries only if we find ourselves with a niche use case that really requires the extra flexibility, such that the extra developer time is worthwhile. We will also want to pick setting that allow us to fit and evaluate model performance quickly. This means limiting ourselves to moderately sized networks and fast fits (this tends to constrain the hyperparameter exploration we might do)."

    "One of the interesting things to me about deep models is that they can be thought of as deconstructed Machine Learning models. A machine learning model basically consists of three parts:\n",
    "- A calculation engine. In the LR model above, this is logistic function.\n",
    "- An optimization method, also known as a learning algorithm. The default sklearn logistic regression uses the LIBLINEAR library, which implements the Trust Region Newton Method (see http://fa.bianp.net/blog/2013/numerical-optimizers-for-logistic-regression/ for more details).\n",
    "- A cost function, also known as a loss function, which is the thing to be minimized by the optimization method. For the LR model we set up, this is least square + the L1 regularization term.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep models we need to declare all of these explicitly, which we'll do below."

    "So there you have it. We've completed one use case, one commonly used in products and payments technology companies to identify fraudulent transactions. But this use case touches on one of the core issues we need to address in enterprise contexts: __In real world data sets, truthiness is squishy.__\n",
    "\n",
    "What I mean by this is that in datasets like MNIST, there is a clear True/False condition in the training data- either an image is a 3 or it is not. Even with the labeled categorical data we still can't be completely sure of the True/False condition. A human might have mislabeled it, or the system determining the label could have been wrong. Moreover, in some cases (hospital admissions being a canonical one), even having a True label isn't quite accurate because having received that label is probabilistic. What this leads to is that the hardest part isn't the fitting of the models, or the deployment of the product (although there are parts of this that are annoyingly difficult), but rather the formulation of the problem. Until next time."
